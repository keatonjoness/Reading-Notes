## Color

We used color with different ways:

<ol>
    <li>RGB ` color : rgb(0-255,0-255,0-255)`</li>
    <li>Hex codes color : #ee3e80</li>
    <li>Color names color : red;</li>
</ol>

* We can choose the background or foreground color using this ways.

* Each element have a background color value .

* When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.


* **low constract lower** - contrast between background and foreground colors.

* **meduim constract** - For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.

* **high constract** - higher contrast between background and foreground colors.

* Opacity allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0.

* HSL colors for hue , saturation ,lightness.

## Text 

### Typeface

* Serif- fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.

* Sans-Serif- fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

* Monospace- Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)

<ol>
    <li>weigth values are light, meduim ,bold , dolder.</li>
    <li>Style values are italic ,Normal, Oblique.</li>
    <li>Stretch values are Condensed ,Regular ,Extended.</li>
</ol>

* Size of Typed Letters

<ol>
    <li>pixels- are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px. </li>
    
    <li>percentages- The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.</li>
    
    <li>ems- is equivalent to the width of a letter m.</li>
</ol>
