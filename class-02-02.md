# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML List

Four Types of HTML Lists:

* Ordered List: A numbered list of items.
* Unordered List: A bulleted list of items.
* Definition List: list of terms and definitons.
* Nested List: A list within a list.

## CSS Box

In CSS, each HTML element has itâ€™s own box. You can adjust the boxes by changing the boxes width and height properties. <br>
There's plenty of adjustable elements that make up a box such as padding, borders, and margins.

<ul>
    <li> Box Dimensions: width, height </li>
    <li> Limiting Width: min-width, max-width </li>
    <li> Limiting Height: min-height, max-height </li>
    <li> Overflowing Content: overflow </li>
</ul>

Every box has "three properties" that can be adjusted, which controls its appearance.:

<ol>
    <li>Border</li>
    <li>Margin</li>
    <li>Padding</li>
</ol>

Other Properties:

<ul>
    <li> border-width </li>
    <li> border-style </li>
    <li> border-color </li>
    <li> text-align </li>
    <li> display </li>
    <li> visibility </li>
    <li> border-image </li>
    <li> box-shadow </li>
    <li> border radius </li>
</ul>

## Control Flow with JavaScript

An array is a special type of variable that stores a list of values rather than just one. They are helpful when you don't know the amount of items the list will contain. You create an array just like any other variable.

The Different Data Types:

<ol>
    <li>Boolean- This data type has a value of either true or false.</li>
    <li>Numeric- This data type has a value that deals ith numbers.</li>
    <li>String- This data type has a value of letters and characters.</li>
</ol>


* **Loops** always check a condition.

Loops:

* For- Use to run code certain number of times.
* While- Use to run if you dont know the amount of times the code needs to run.
* Do While- This is similar to the while loop. The only difference is the statements will run in the curly brackets at least once.
