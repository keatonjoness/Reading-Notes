### Version Control 

 Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a  <br>
 file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a <br>
 file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, <br>
 and compare changes.

 * **Local Version Control**
 * **Centralized Version Control**
 * **Distributed Version Control**
 
 ### What is Git

 It is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work <br>
 among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. <br>
 Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

 ### Git Repository
 
 This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building <br>
 a history over time. Meaning, if you delete the Git folder, then you delete <br>
 your projectâ€™s history. 

 ### Remote Repositories

 They let you easily work on different branches simultaneously. <br>
 When you pause work on one branch and switch to a new one,  <br>
 you won't be asked about stashing changes - they'll automatically <br>
 stay on the previous branch.
