# Dynamic Java
* An object-oriented computer programming language commonly <br>
  used to create interactive effects within web browsers.


* It conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, <br>
  often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, <br> 
  dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 


* Java enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of <br>
  web applications. A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers <br>
  have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it. JavaScript is single threaded.
