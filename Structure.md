  elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. <br>

* There are handwritten and digital wireframes.

### HTML 

* Language that defines the structure of your content.
  
* HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, <br>
  or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, <br>
  or act a certain way.

### Semantics

* The branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning.

* There are a number of branches and subbranches of semantics, including formal semantics, <br>
  which studies the logical aspects of meaning, such as sense, reference, implication, <br>
  and logical form, lexical semantics, which studies word meanings and word relations, <br>
  and conceptual semantics, which studies the cognitive structure of meaning.
