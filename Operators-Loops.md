# Operators and Loops

### Loops

Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. <nr>
Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue <br>
running until the defined condition returns false .

**Statement Loops**

* for statement
* do...while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* for...in statement
* for...of statement

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. <br>
There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.
